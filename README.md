## ❓ Problem Statement

Shield Insurance needed a unified analytics solution to:

- Track **total revenue and daily/monthly customer growth**
- Understand **policy trends** on a month-over-month basis
- Identify **high-value customer segments** by age group and city
- Compare **sales channel (mode) performance** across geographies
- Analyze **settlement efficiency** across demographic groups

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- 📍 **Delhi NCR** is the highest-value market — 11,007 customers generating ₹401.57M in revenue
- 📍 The **65+ age segment**, despite smaller headcount, drives ₹204M — an underserved premium cohort
- 📍 **Offline-Agent** leads with 55.67% of total revenue, but online channels show a growth trajectory
- 📍 The **31–40 age group** has the largest customer base at 10.45K customers
- 📍 Daily customer growth surged **109.88% MoM** (162 → 340), validating current acquisition strategies

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Target the **65+ segment** with tailored premium policy offerings — high revenue potential, currently underserved
- Invest in **digital channel infrastructure** (Online-App, Online-Website) to capture the younger demographic shift
- Double down on **Delhi NCR and Mumbai** as primary revenue markets while developing emerging cities like Indore
- Improve **settlement processes** for the 51–65 and 65+ age groups to strengthen trust and retention
